Vintage art in the public domain, traced into vector format.

I'm trawling through old magazines, publications, etc. that have lapsed into the public domain, currently from the late 1800s to early 1900s, extracting ornamental visual elements, and converting them into vector format (SVG). 
They're available for free, but you can support me at https://paypal.me/delsdoodles if you like (or https://ko-fi.com/welshpixie).

The folder 'Valhalla' contains art traced by Elena ``of Valhalla'' Grandi and very kindly provided for including in this pack. https://github.com/valholl <3
